Software Architecture Kata

##Show Me The Money!
- A local community college wants a new accounting system, because the old one sucks pretty badly.
- Projected users: 1000+ users, staff and faculty, most of them local (but some nationwide or overseas)
- Restriction: no web app (the president hates the web), minimal software costs
- Requirements: enforce the college's accounting workflow but still allow for individual departments to amend that workflow to suit their own needs; keep complete audit trail records

## Design Considerations 
- User Personas
- Features
- Use Cases / User Stories
- Constraints / Risks
- Security
- Accessibility
- Integrations / Legacy Data
- QA / Testing
- Required Skills / Technology
- Cost / Budget
